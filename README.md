Arkade S3 Extension for Magento
===============================

Arkade's S3 extension for Magento allows retailers to upload their catalogue and WYSIWYG media assets (such as images and videos) straight to Amazon S3.

Benefits
--------

### Easy to use

This extension is easy to use with little configuration! You only need to follow a few simple steps to get up and running!

### Sync all your media assets

The following assets are automatically saved to S3:

* Product images
* Generated thumbnails
* WYSIWYG images
* WYSIWYG videos
* Category images
* Favicon
* CAPTCHA images

### Magento can now scale horizontally

Complex file syncing between multiple servers is now a thing of the past with this extension. All your servers will be able to share the one S3 bucket as the single source of media.

### Easy integration with CloudFront CDN

CloudFront CDN supports using S3 as an origin server so you can significantly reduce load on your servers.

FAQs
----

### Does this extension upload my log files?

No, the S3 extension only syncs across the media folder. You will need to find an alternative solution to store your log files.

### We did something wrong and all our images are gone! Can you restore it?

We always recommend taking a backup of your media files when switching file storage systems. Unfortunately, we wonâ€™t be able to restore images if you somehow accidentally delete them.
